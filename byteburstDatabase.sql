Summer Lee, D-Pa., on Wednesday. Like other progressive members of the Squad, pro-Israel groups are seeking to oust Lee in 2024.</p> <br><p>Members of the House Democratic leadership have mostly remained close to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee even as it sought to unseat Democratic incumbents. On Wednesday, though, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., bucked AIPAC, a major donor, and endorsed Lee. House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., and House Minority Whip Katherine Clark, D-Mass., joined Jeffries in the endorsement.</p> <br><p>“A civil rights champion, advocate for organized labor and the first Black woman to represent Pennsylvania in Congress, Summer Lee has worked tirelessly to deliver for working families,” the three leaders said in a statement Wednesday morning. They added that Lee had fought for good union jobs and reproductive rights since her first day in Congress and would help oppose “the extreme MAGA Republican agenda” in Pennsylvania.</p> <br><p>The endorsements are among the first by House Democratic leadership for a progressive incumbent facing attacks from AIPAC and other pro-Israel lobbying groups in 2024.

Bernie Sanders forced a vote ON TUESDAY, THE Senate voted down a resolution that would have set the stage for Congress to place conditions on U.S. military aid to Israel — quashing what has so far been the most serious effort on Capitol Hill to hold the U.S. ally to account for its brutal assault on Gaza. on the resolution, which would have opened the door for Congress to freeze U.S. aid to Israel.</p> <br><p>Introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., in December, the resolution would have required the State Department to submit a report to Congress about allegations of Israel committing human rights violations, and whether and how the U.S. played a role and responded to such acts. If the bill had passed and the State Department failed to submit the report within 30 days, U.S. aid to Israel would have been frozen. If the State Department had submitted a report to Congress, however, U.S. aid to Israel could have come to a vote, giving Congress the option to condition, restrict, or terminate security assistance to Israel (or to do nothing at all). Such votes would have required only a simple majority for passage.</p> <br><p>When it came to a vote Tuesday evening, the Senate voted 72-11 to table the resolution, effectively killing it. </p> <br><p>“It’s frankly historic that this vote took place at all,” said Andrew O’Neill, the legislative director for the political advocacy group Indivisible. “The number of senators willing to take a vote like this even weeks ago, on the face of it, would have been zero.”</p> <br><p>Israel receives billions of dollars per year in U.S. aid, making it the largest recipient of American security assistance in the world. In the wake of Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel, President Joe Biden asked Congress to approve an additional $14 billion in aid to the country, whose retaliatory war on Gaza has killed more than 24,000 Palestinians.</p> <br><p>Sanders’s resolution was based on the Foreign Assistance Act, which prohibits the American government from providing security assistance to any government “which engages in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.” Section 502B(c) of the law empowers Congress to request information on a country’s human rights practices, which Sanders took advantage of to force this vote.</p> <br><p>“The Senators who lent their support to this resolution did so in spite of enormous political pressure,” O’Neill said, noting that, for decades, there has been a bipartisan status quo of not scrutinizing assistance to Israel. “The 502B process had never been used before, and now that tool is on the table. These are lonely votes, but votes that can be the start of something bigger.”</p> <br><p>THE VOTES IN support for Sanders’s resolution came almost entirely from Democratic senators: Laphonza Butler of California, Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico, Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, and Peter Welch of Vermont. Rand Paul was the only Republican to vote against tabling the resolution. </p> <br><p>Van Hollen told The Intercept that it’s important for the Senate to get the information required by the proposed report. “That’s important for transparency and I think taxpayers have a right to know how their funds are being used.”</p> <br><p>Speaking with reporters ahead of the vote, Warren said, “Prime Minister Netanyahu needs to understand that he does not get a blank check from the United States Congress.”</p> <br><p>She continued: “The Senate has had a role in overseeing our military involvement overseas running back to the drafting of the Constitution. We have a responsibility to stand up now and say that given how Netanyahu and his right-wing war cabinet have prosecuted this war, we have serious questions that we are obligated to ask before we go further.”</p> <br><p>Some Democratic senators who voted to kill the resolution told The Intercept they were concerned about Israeli human rights abuses, but they did not think Sanders’s proposal was the way to address them. Others, mostly Republicans, deflected from questions about Israel’s conduct during the war. </p> <br><p>Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., said he was opposed to the resolution because the timeline for potential congressional action would have conflicted with the aims of Israel’s war. “It doesn’t make a lot of sense to be conditioning a military campaign engaged in by an ally,” he said. He added that “there’s no question if there are allegations, they will be the subject of scrutiny and review,” but said he doesn’t think the resolution is the right approach.</p> <br><p>Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., explained his opposition to the resolution by pointing out that 502B(c) has never been used in its 50-year history, and that he prefers a measureOpens in a new tab introduced by Van Hollen. That amendment would require weapons received by any country under Biden’s proposal for supplemental aid to Israel and Ukraine to be used in accordance with U.S. law, international humanitarian law, and the law of armed conflict.</p> <br><p>Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who has a record of scrutinizing human rights abuses by U.S. allies, voted against the resolution. He told The Intercept that he supports Israel’s right to defend itself and that he has deep reservations about the way it has conducted its campaign, but he doesn’t support measures “potentially designed to cut off funding for Israel.” The resolution, he said, is a vehicle toward completely cutting off aid to Israel. “I don’t think that’s the right move for Congress at this time,” he said. </p> <br><p>Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., told The Intercept that he is “sensitive” to the allegations of human rights abuses by Israel, and that he understands Sanders’s sensitivity to “trying to keep the collateral damage down, and I think everybody would be for that.” Still, he said, he opposed the resolution “because I think it then draws attention away from how it started, and how it has to be litigated, and that’s not easy,” referring to Hamas’s attack on October 7 and Israel’s stated aim of rooting out the organization.</p> <br><p>Asked if he thought Israel was doing enough to mitigate civilian casualties, Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., told The Intercept that “they need to kill every Hamas member and anybody that dies in Gaza is a result of Hamas.” He voted against the resolution. </p> <br><p>Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., referred to Hamas’s attack on Israel as he explained his opposition to the resolution. “To give them respite would be to allow them to do it again,” he told The Intercept. When asked whether Israel is doing enough to protect civilians, Cassidy repeated a frequent Israeli government talking point about Hamas, saying that “when you build your tunnels with your commanders beneath mosques, hospitals, and schools, then you have created an environment where it’s difficult to prevent civilian injury.”</p> <br><p>On his way to vote against the resolution, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, told The Intercept that he has been consistent with his position on the issue. “Of course it does,” he said when asked if he’s concerned about the number of casualties in Gaza. Asked if Israel is doing enough to mitigate the casualties, he responded simply: “Good talking to you,” as the Senate elevator doors closed.</p> <br>', 1),

The new policyOpens in a new tab retains an injunction not to “use our service to harm yourself or others” and gives “develop or use weapons” as an example, but the blanket ban on “military and warfare” use has vanished.</p> <br><p>The unannounced redaction is part of a major rewrite of the policy page, which the company said was intended to make the document “clearer” and “more readable,” and which includes many other substantial language and formatting changes.</p> <br><p>“We aimed to create a set of universal principles that are both easy to remember and apply, especially as our tools are now globally used by everyday users who can now also build GPTs,” OpenAI spokesperson Niko Felix said in an email to The Intercept. “A principle like ‘Don’t harm others’ is broad yet easily grasped and relevant in numerous contexts. Additionally, we specifically cited weapons and injury to others as clear examples.”</p> <br><p>Felix declined to say whether the vaguer “harm” ban encompassed all military use, writing, “Any use of our technology, including by the military, to ‘[develop] or [use] weapons, [injure] others or [destroy] property, or [engage] in unauthorized activities that violate the security of any service or system,’ is disallowed.”</p> <br><p>In a subsequent email, Felix added that OpenAI wanted to pursue certain “national security use cases that align with our mission,” citing a plan to create “cybersecurity tools” with DARPA, and that “the goal with our policy update is to provide clarity and the ability to have these discussions.”</p> <br><p>“OpenAI is well aware of the risk and harms that may arise due to the use of their technology and services in military applications,” said Heidy Khlaaf, engineering director at the cybersecurity firm Trail of Bits and an expert on machine learning and autonomous systems safety, citing a 2022 paper Opens in a new tabshe co-authored with OpenAI researchers that specifically flagged the risk of military use. Khlaaf added that the new policy seems to emphasize legality over safety. “There is a distinct difference between the two policies, as the former clearly outlines that weapons development, and military and warfare is disallowed, while the latter emphasizes flexibility and compliance with the law,” she said. “Developing weapons, and carrying out activities related to military and warfare is lawful to various extents. The potential implications for AI safety are significant. Given the well-known instances of bias and hallucination present within Large Language Models (LLMs), and their overall lack of accuracy, their use within military warfare can only lead to imprecise and biased operations that are likely to exacerbate harm and civilian casualties.”</p> <br><p>The real-world consequences of the policy are unclear. Last year, The Intercept reported that OpenAI was unwilling to say whether it would enforce its own clear “military and warfare” ban in the face of increasing interest from the Pentagon and U.S. intelligence community.</p> <br><p>“Given the use of AI systems in the targeting of civilians in Gaza, it’s a notable moment to make the decision to remove the words ‘military and warfare’ from OpenAI’s permissible use policy,” said Sarah Myers West, managing director of the AI Now Institute and a former AI policy analyst at the Federal Trade Commission. “The language that is in the policy remains vague and raises questions about how OpenAI intends to approach enforcement.”</p> <br><p>While nothing OpenAI offers today could plausibly be used to directly kill someone, militarily or otherwise — ChatGPT can’t maneuver a drone or fire a missile — any military is in the business of killing, or at least maintaining the capacity to kill. There are any number of killing-adjacent tasks that a LLM like ChatGPT could augment, like writing code or processing procurementOpens in a new tab orders. A review of custom ChatGPT-powered bots offered by OpenAI suggests U.S. military personnel are alreadyOpens in a new tab usingOpens in a new tab the technology to expedite paperwork. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which directly aids U.S. combat efforts, has openly speculated about using ChatGPT to aid its human analystsOpens in a new tab. Even if OpenAI tools were deployed by portions of a military force for purposes that aren’t directly violent, they would still be aiding an institution whose main purpose is lethality.</p> <br><p>Experts who reviewed the policy changes at The Intercept’s request said OpenAI appears to be silently weakening its stance against doing business with militaries. “I could imagine that the shift away from ‘military and warfare’ to ‘weapons’ leaves open a space for OpenAI to support operational infrastructures as long as the application doesn’t directly involve weapons development narrowly defined,” said Lucy Suchman, professor emerita of anthropology of science and technology at Lancaster University. “Of course, I think the idea that you can contribute to warfighting platforms while claiming not to be involved in the development or use of weapons would be disingenuous, removing the weapon from the sociotechnical system – including command and control infrastructures – of which it’s part.” Suchman, a scholar of artificial intelligence since the 1970s and member of the International Committee for Robot Arms Control, added, “It seems plausible that the new policy document evades the question of military contracting and warfighting operations by focusing specifically on weapons.”</p> <br><p>Suchman and Myers West both pointed to OpenAI’s close partnership with Microsoft, a major defense contractor, which has invested $13 billion in the LLM maker to date and resells the company’s software tools.</p> <br><p>he changes come as militaries around the world are eager to incorporate machine learning techniques to gain an advantage; the Pentagon is still tentatively exploring how it might use ChatGPT or other large-language models, a type of software tool that can rapidly and dextrously generate sophisticated text outputs. LLMs are trained on giant volumes of books, articles, and other web data in order to approximate human responses to user prompts. Though the outputs of an LLM like ChatGPT are often extremely convincing, they are optimized for coherence rather than a firm grasp on reality and often suffer from so-called hallucinations that make accuracy and factuality a problem. Still, the ability of LLMs to quickly ingest text and rapidly output analysis — or at least the simulacrum of analysis — makes them a natural fit for the data-laden Defense Department.</p> <br><p>While some within U.S. military leadership have expressed concernOpens in a new tab about the tendency of LLMs to insert glaring factual errors or other distortions, as well as security risks that might come with using ChatGPT to analyze classified or otherwise sensitive data, the Pentagon remains generally eager to adopt artificial intelligence tools. In a November address, Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks statedOpens in a new tab that AI is “a key part of the comprehensive, warfighter-centric approach to innovation that Secretary [Lloyd] Austin and I have been driving from Day 1,” though she cautioned that most current offerings “aren’t yet technically mature enough to comply with our ethical AI principles.”</p> <br><p>Last year, Kimberly Sablon, the Pentagon’s principal director for trusted AI and autonomy, toldOpens in a new tab a conference in Hawaii that “[t]here’s a lot of good there in terms of how we can utilize large-language models like [ChatGPT] to disrupt critical functions across the department.”</p> <br>', 1),

While most of the product images are anodyne promotional photos showing the drone from various angles, including carrying a generic cargo container, three show a very different payload: what appears to be a cluster of four explosive shells tucked underneath, a configuration similar to those seen in bomb-dropping drones deployed in Ukraine and elsewhere. Samuel Bendett, an analyst with the Center for Naval Analyses, told The Intercept that the shells resembled mortar rounds. Arms analyst Patrick Senft said the ordnance shown might actually be toy replicas, as they “don’t resemble any munitions I’ve seen deployed by UAV.”</p> <br><p>Contacted by email, an OBDPRICE representative who identified themselves only as “Alex” told The Intercept: “The drone products we sell cannot be used for military purposes.” When asked why the site was then depicting the drone product in question carrying camouflage-patterned explosive shells, they wrote: “You may have misunderstood, those are some lighting devices that help our users illuminate themselves at night.” The site has not responded to further queries, but shortly after being contacted by The Intercept, the mortar-carrying images were deleted.</p> <br><p>Iturbe also identified a separate listing from an Autel storefront on eBayOpens in a new tab using the very same three images of an armed Titan drone.

These datasets often contain gold mines of revelations in the public interest and in many cases are freely available for anyone to download. </p> <br><p>Revelations based on leaked datasets can change the course of history. In 1971, Daniel Ellsberg’s leak of military documents known as the Pentagon Papers led to the end of the Vietnam War. The same year, an underground activist group called the Citizens’ Commission to Investigate the FBI broke into a Federal Bureau of Investigation field office, stole secret documents, and leaked them to the media. This dataset mentioned COINTELPRO. NBC reporter Carl Stern used Freedom of Information Act requests to publicly reveal that COINTELPRO was a secret FBI operation devoted to surveilling, infiltrating, and discrediting left-wing political groups. This stolen FBI dataset also led to the creation of the Church Committee, a Senate committee that investigated these abuses and reined them in. </p> <br><p>Huge data leaks like these used to be rare, but today they’re increasingly common. More recently, Chelsea Manning’s 2010 leaks of Iraq and Afghanistan documents helped spark the Arab Spring, documents and emails stolen by Russian military hackers helped elect Donald Trump as U.S. president in 2016, and the Panama Papers and Paradise Papers exposed how the rich and powerful use offshore shell companies for tax evasion.</p> <br><p>Yet these digital tomes can prove extremely difficult to analyze or interpret, and few people today have the skills to do so. I spent the last two years writing the book “Hacks, Leaks, and Revelations: The Art of Analyzing Hacked and Leaked DataOpens in a new tab” to teach journalists, researchers, and activists the technologies and coding skills required to do just this. While these topics are technical, my book doesn’t assume any prior knowledge: all you need is a computer, an internet connection, and the will to learn. Throughout the book, you’ll download and analyze real datasets — including those from police departments, fascist groups, militias, a Russian ransomware gang, and social networks — as practice. Throughout, you’ll engage head-on with the dumpster fire that is 21st-century current events: the rise of neofascism and the rejection of objective reality, the extreme partisan divide, and an internet overflowing with misinformation.</p> <br><p>My book officially comes out January 9, but it’s shipping today if you order it from the publisher hereOpens in a new tab. Add the code INTERCEPT25 for a special 25 percent discount.</p> <br><p>The following is a lightly edited excerpt from the first chapter of “Hacks, Leaks, and Revelations” about a crucial and often underappreciated part of working with leaked data: how to verify that it’s authentic.</p> <br><p>OU CAN’T BELIEVE everything you read on the internet, and juicy documents or datasets that anonymous people send you are no exception. Disinformation is prevalent.\r\n</p> <br><p>How you go about verifying that a dataset is authentic completely depends on what the data is. You have to approach the problem on a case-by-case basis. The best way to verify a dataset is to use open source intelligence (OSINT), or publicly available information that anyone with enough skill can find. \r\n\r\n</p> <br><p>This might mean scouring social media accounts, consulting the Internet Archive’s Wayback MachineOpens in a new tab, inspecting metadata of public images or documents, paying services for historical domain name registration data, or viewing other types of public records. If your dataset includes a database taken from a website, for instance, you might be able to compare information in that database with publicly available information on the website itself to confirm that they match. (Michael Bazzell also has great resourcesOpens in a new tab on the tools and techniques of OSINT.)\r\n\r\n</p> <br><p>Below, I share two examples of authenticating data from my own experience: one about a dataset from the anti-vaccine group America’s Frontline Doctors, and another about leaked chat logs from a WikiLeaks Twitter group. \r\n</p> <br><p>In my work at The Intercept, I encounter datasets so frequently I feel like I’m drowning in data, and I simply ignore most of them because it’s impossible for me to investigate them all. Unfortunately, this often means that no one will report on them, and their secrets will remain hidden forever. I hope “Hacks, Leaks, and Revelations” helps to change that. </p> <br>', 1),

His plan, he told investigators, was to illegally use his tag for a future hunt.</p> <br><p>The Marine, whose name is redacted in the report, had a history of legal infractions, the agents soon discovered, including a warning from a Wyoming wildlife law enforcement officer for harming or killing a kit fox. They seized his recording devices. Besides photos of the dead bear and elk, they found pictures of a bald eagle carcass. The Marine claimed he had nothing to do with the bird’s death.\n\n</p> <br><p>Killing an endangered or threatened species in self-defense is not a crime. Cutting off a grizzly’s claw for a souvenir, however, is a clear violation of the Endangered Species Act and associated regulations. In their incident report, the feds determined that the Marine had likely violated a slew of federal and state laws.</p> <br><p>The hunter was found guilty of wasting an elk under a Wyoming state law and ordered to pay a $640 fine. A federal prosecutor, however, declined to bring chargesOpens in a new tab under the ESA. The Marine faced no consequences for desecrating a protected grizzly bear.</p> <br>', 1),
(87, 'ST. LOUIS COUNTY PROSECUTOR SEEKS TO VACATE DEATH PENALTY CONVICTION OF MARCELLUS WILLIAMS', 'justice', '<img src=\"../ImageBase/Williams-Marcellus-the-intercept (1).webp\" alt=\"article-image\"><p>Citing crime scene DNA that belonged to someone else, Wesley Bell asked a Missouri court to consider evidence of Williams’s innocence.</p> <br><p>ST. LOUIS COUNTY Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell is seeking to vacate the conviction of Marcellus Williams, who was sent to Missouri’s death row in 2001 for a murder he swore he did not commit.</p> <br><p>Forensic testing of the knife used to murder Felicia Anne Gayle Picus, a beloved former newspaper reporter, revealed male DNA that did not belong to Williams. That evidence, which supports Williams’s innocence claim, has never been reviewed by any court, Bell noted in a newly filed motionOpens in a new tab. “This never-before-considered evidence, when paired with the relative paucity of other, credible evidence supporting guilt … casts inexorable doubt on Mr. Williams’s conviction and sentence,” the motion reads.</p> <br><p>Bell is invoking a relatively new provision of Missouri law that allows prosecutors to intervene in cases when they have “information that the convicted person may be innocent.” Bell asked the St. Louis County Circuit Court, where Williams was convicted, to set a hearing to consider the DNA evidence and other serious flaws in the case against Williams, including poor defense lawyering at trial and misconduct by prosecutors, who stuck qualified individuals from the jury pool because they were Black.</p> <br><p>Bell’s office is also reviewing the police investigation of Williams to determine if it was “intentionally or recklessly deficient” and is conducting a probe into an “alternate perpetrator.” That inquiry involves forensic testing, which will take time, the motion notes. Still, Bell believes it is his duty now to ask the court to “correct this manifest injustice by seeking a hearing on the newfound evidence and the integrity of Mr. Williams’s conviction.” The request is all the more urgent because Missouri’s attorney general has asked the state Supreme Court to set a date for Williams’s execution.</p> <br><p>PICUS’S HUSBAND, DAN, came home from work on August 11, 1998, to find his wife dead. The former St. Louis Post-Dispatch reporter had been stabbed repeatedly, and the murder weapon, a knife from the couple’s kitchen, was left lodged in her neck. The house was full of forensic evidence: There were pubic hairs found near the body, bloody fingerprints on a wall, and a trail of bloody shoeprints. The kitchen had been ransacked, and closets and drawers upstairs had been opened. Not much of value was taken; Picus’s wedding ring and $400 in cash were still in her walk-in closet. But a few items were missing, among them Picus’s wallet and Dan’s old Apple laptop computer.</p> <br><p>Despite the wealth of physical evidence, the case quickly stalled out. It wasn’t until months later, after Picus’s family posted a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of her killer, that a jailhouse informant named Henry Cole came forward with a story about his former cellmate, Marcellus Williams, whom he said had confessed to the murder. Police subsequently secured a second informant, Laura Asaro, Williams’s former girlfriend, who also claimed Williams was responsible.</p> <br><p>There was ample reason for police and prosecutors to be wary of the accounts: The informants were both facing prison time for unrelated crimes and had a history of ratting on others to save themselves. Many of the details Cole and Asaro offered shifted over the course of questioning, while others did not match the crime. Nonetheless, Williams was charged with Picus’s murder. When Cole’s support for the endeavor appeared to flag before trial, prosecutors encouraged Dan to pay him $5,000 to secure his testimony.</p> <br><p>Although Cole and Asaro were the foundation of the state’s case against Williams, painting him as a ruthless killer, their stories contradicted the physical evidence. Asaro claimed Williams had scratches on his face the day of the murder, yet no foreign DNA was recovered from under Picus’s fingernails. The bloody shoeprints in the house were a different size than Williams’s feet, and the pubic hairs found near Picus’s body didn’t belong to Williams. In his trial testimony, Cole claimed that Williams bragged about wearing gloves during the murder, despite the bloody fingerprints left behind. The fingerprints lifted by investigators were deemed unusable by the state and destroyed before the defense had a chance to analyze them.</p> <br><p>The Apple computer, however, was eventually recovered by police. According to Asaro, Williams had given his grandfather’s neighbor the computer in exchange for crack cocaine. At trial, the neighbor denied that account, saying he’d paid Williams cash for the laptop. What the jury didn’t know was that the man also said Williams was pawning the computer for Asaro.</p> <br><p>According to Bell’s motion, Williams’s trial attorneys provided him with ineffective representation by failing to call witnesses who could have undercut the credibility of Cole and Asaro. Among those witnesses was Cole’s son, Johnifer, who said that while Cole was locked up with Williams, he’d written Johnifer a letter to report that he had a “caper” going on and “something big” was coming.</p> <br><p>Williams’s conviction was also tarnished by the prosecutors, who illegally struck several potential Black jurors from service. In one instance, a prosecutor said they hadn’t rejected the juror because he was Black, but because he “looked very similar” to the defendant. (The prosecutor also claimed he struck the juror because he was a mail processing supervisor for the postal service, and postal employees are “very liberal.” He did not use the same logic to disqualify a white postal employee.)</p> <br><p>The St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office has a well-documented history of striking Black jurors from serving on death penalty cases, Bell noted in his motion. The prosecutors who handled Williams’s case have had at least two other death penalty convictions reversed by the Missouri Supreme Court based on such violations.</p> <br><p>WILLIAMS’S LAWYERS REQUESTED DNA testing of crime scene evidence prior to his trial, but the court denied it. It wasn’t until 2015 — on the eve of Williams’s first execution date — that the Missouri Supreme Court stayed the case and ordered testing of the murder weapon, which ultimately revealed unknown male DNA. The court reset Williams’s execution for August 2017 without considering the impact of the DNA results on his conviction.</p> <br><p>The Midwest Innocence Project, which represents Williams, turned to Missouri’s then-Gov. Eric Greitens, asking that he halt the execution and convene what’s known as a board of inquiry to investigate the case. On the day Williams was set to die, Greitens issued an executive order granting the request.</p> <br><p>Greitens empaneled a five-member board of retired judges to “assess the credibility and weight of all the evidence.” The board was given subpoena power and tasked with making a final report to the governor “as to whether or not Williams should be executed or his sentenced of death commuted.”</p> <br><p>Over the intervening years, the Midwest Innocence Project provided the board with a host of information and suggestions for lines of inquiry. Then, last June, Greitens’s successor, Gov. Mike Parson, abruptly dissolved the board of inquiry before it could report the findings of its investigation. It was time to move on, Parson said. The following day, Attorney General Andrew Bailey asked the Missouri Supreme Court to set an execution date for Williams.</p> <br>', 1),

They are not myopic single-issue voters, willing to throw reproductive rights under the bus. Feminists opposing Biden in the name of Palestinian liberation are highlighting the cynicism of a Democratic campaign running on women’s rights at home while enabling the systematic annihilation of women and children abroad.</p> <br><p>Humanitarian agencies this month reportedOpens in a new tab a 300 percentOpens in a new tab rise in the miscarriage rate in Gaza since Israel’s bombardment began. More than 10,000 children have been killed, and there is not a safe place in the besieged strip for a person to give birth.

Just this week, Republicans in Tennessee and Oklahoma introducedOpens in a new tab travel ban bills that would make it a felony to help a minor leave the state to access abortion care. Nearly 65,000 pregnancies associated with rape occurred in the 14 states that have enacted abortion bans since the Dobbs decision to overturn Roe in 2022.</p> <br><p>Biden warning’s that it could get far worse under Trump is as uninspiring as it is gravely real.

In the years following the 1973 ruling, Black feminist organizers led the demand for a framework of “reproductive justiceOpens in a new tab” beyond reproductive rights, which encompasses far more than the right to end a pregnancy.</p> <br><p>The fight for reproductive justice is the fight to produce, reproduce, and sustain life in conditions of freedom and safety — the very conditions the current administration is rendering impossible, from its own borders to Gaza. Accessing abortion in Palestine was extremely challengingOpens in a new tab prior to the war; now the challenge is staying alive to navigate any such choices and challenges at all.</p> <br><p>Asking feminists to limit their concerns to abortion access in the U.S. is to push a liberal nationalist feminism that simply inverts the Christo-fascism of white women Trump voters.

(90, 'WILL THE SUPREME COURT FORCE OKLAHOMA TO KILL RICHARD GLOSSIP?', 'justice', '<img src=\"../ImageBase/glossip-scotus-feat-1-copy.webp\" alt=\"article-image\"><p>Almost 10 years after the court greenlit Glossip’s execution, the justices have agreed to hear evidence of his innocence.</p> <br><p>FOR THE LAST four months, Richard Glossip and his wife, Lea, have had a regular Monday ritual. Glossip calls Lea from his death row cell first thing in the morning. Lea makes coffee in her Oklahoma City apartment while they talk. And then she opens the computer. “We would open the docket and check the orders list from the Supreme Court,” she said. “It’s always a huge moment that’s wrapped up with so many emotions and this kind of terrifying anticipation.”</p> <br><p>In May, the court blocked Glossip’s looming execution while it decided whether to take up his most recent appeal. The couple knew that a decision wouldn’t come before the fall. But fall came and went as they dutifully made their weekly docket checks. Glossip’s case just wasn’t there. The court kept putting off its decision. Over time, they grew comfortable not knowing, relieved to be able to enjoy the holidays in relative peace after a long and stressful year.</p> <br><p>Then on January 22, there it was. “All of a sudden, I said, ‘It’s there. I see Glossip.’” The court had decided to review the case. “I told him, ‘It’s granted! It’s granted!’”</p> <br><img src=\"../ImageBase/GettyImages-1915438281-Oklahoma-Attorney-General-Gentner-Drummond.webp\" alt=\"article-image\"><p>Lea felt a rush of emotion. “It was really overwhelming.” She told Glossip to call his lawyer, Don Knight. “We’re going to Washington,” Knight responded.</p> <br><p>The truth is that the situation is both a blessing and a curse. Glossip has learned the hard way not to put his faith in the Supreme Court. Nearly 10 years ago, Glossip was the named plaintiffOpens in a new tab in a challenge to Oklahoma’s controversial new lethal injection protocol. After oral arguments in the spring of 2015, the justices quickly dismissed concerns that the method could amount to torture. The ruling greased the wheels for Glossip’s execution, which would have gone forward later that year if not for a last-minute revelation that the state had procured the wrong combination of drugs, forcing it to call things off. The state later revealed that it had already used the same erroneous protocol to execute a different man.</p> <br><p>The fallout over Glossip’s near-execution was swift. The state issued a moratorium on executions and an independent bipartisan commission was formed to study Oklahoma’s death penalty from top to bottom. In 2017, the commission issued a sweeping indictment of the system. Among its conclusions: The state of Oklahoma had condemned innocent people to death. The commission also offered a host of recommendations for reform; to date, virtually none of them have been implemented. In 2021, Oklahoma restarted executions using the same three-drug protocol as before.</p> <br><p>Meanwhile, Glossip’s case began to draw more national attention — particularly after Investigation Discovery aired documentarian Joe Berlinger’s four-part seriesOpens in a new tab on the case. “Killing Richard Glossip,” which was inspired by The Intercept’s reporting, revealed evidence that undercut the state’s case against Glossip, while prompting new witnesses to come forward with information that bolstered his innocence claim. It also galvanized an unlikely contingent of supporters: Powerful state Republican lawmakers became convinced that Glossip was innocent. Determined to save him from execution, they rallied support among their peers and convinced the law firm Reed Smith to undertake a sweeping reinvestigation of the case.</p> <br><img src=\"../ImageBase/Lea-and-Richard-Glossip-prison.webp\" alt=\"article-image\"><p>The resulting 343-page reportOpens in a new tab, released in 2022, painted the clearest picture to date of Glossip’s wrongful conviction. Among its revelationsOpens in a new tab were stunning instances of prosecutorial misconduct. Nevertheless, no sooner had the explosive findings been made public than the state set a fourth execution date for Glossip. </p> <br><p>That Glossip is alive today is thanks in no small part to the Oklahoma’s attorney general, Gentner Drummond, who took office in early 2023. In the first weeks of his term Drummond announcedOpens in a new tab a separate independent inquiry into Glossip’s case by a former elected district attorney and GOP state lawmaker Rex Duncan. Duncan’s reportOpens in a new tab highlighted additional instances of prosecutorial misconduct, prompting Drummond to conclude that the state could not stand by Glossip’s conviction — let alone his execution. In April 2023, Drummond took the unprecedented step of asking the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals to vacate Glossip’s conviction. But the court refused, setting the stage for Glossip’s appeal to the Supreme Court. In a statement, Drummond applaudedOpens in a new tab the justices’ decision to take Glossip’s case. “As Oklahoma’s chief law officer, I will continue fighting to ensure justice is done in this case and every other.”</p> <br><p>GLOSSIP WAS TWICE tried and sentenced to death for the January 1997 murder of Barry Van Treese inside a seedy Best Budget Inn that Van Treese owned on the outskirts of Oklahoma City. No physical evidence linked Glossip, the motel’s 34-year-old manager, to the crime. Instead, the case against him was built almost entirely on the testimony of 19-year-old Justin Sneed, who worked at the motel as a handyman.</p> <br><p>Sneed admitted to murdering Van Treese but claimed that he was coerced by Glossip. On Sneed’s word alone, prosecutors theorized that Glossip wanted Van Treese dead so he could take over operations of the low-rent motel. At trial, they painted Sneed as powerless to resist Glossip’s commands. In exchange for testifying against Glossip, Sneed avoided the death penalty and was sentenced to life without parole.</p> <br><p>Glossip has maintained his innocence, and over the years, evidence of his wrongful conviction has mounted. New evidence suggests that Sneed, a chronic drug user with a violent streak, initially planned to rob Van Treese, then killed him when the plan went sideways. Sneed implicated Glossip in this scheme during a coercive police interrogation. Witnesses who were ignored by police and prosecutors have since come forward to say that Sneed was cunning and manipulative and quite capable of killing a man on his own.</p> <br><p>The multiple inquiries into Glossip’s case have exposed startling police and prosecutorial misconduct. The state destroyed a box of crucial evidence before Glossip was retried in 2004, and prosecutors suppressed evidence that Sneed sought to recant his incriminating testimony. Notes found in the state’s case file also reveal that prosecutors knew that portions of Sneed’s testimony were false.</p> <br><p>Sneed had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and prescribed lithium to manage it by a psychiatrist who evaluated him at the Oklahoma City Jail. At trial, Sneed denied that the evaluation ever took place and said he had no idea why he was given lithium. “I never seen no psychiatrist or anything,” Sneed testified. The prosecutors, who knew about Sneed’s diagnosis, failed to correct his testimony. This failure is in part what animated Drummond’s conclusion that Glossip’s conviction could not stand.</p> <br><p>“There is no dispute that Sneed was the state’s key witness at the second trial. If Sneed had accurately disclosed that he had seen a psychiatrist, then the defense would have likely learned … the true reason for Sneed’s lithium prescription,” Drummond wrote in his motion asking the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals to vacate Glossip’s conviction. “With this information plus Sneed’s history of drug addiction, the state believes that a qualified defense attorney likely could have attacked Sneed’s ability to properly recall key facts at the second trial.”</p> <br><p>“The state has reached the difficult conclusion that the conviction of Glossip was obtained with the benefit of material misstatements to the jury by its key witness,” Drummond wrote.</p> <br><p>The court dismissed Drummond’s conclusions, rejecting the idea that Sneed’s statement was false and suggesting that he was “more than likely in denial of his mental health disorders.” The defense didn’t cross-examine Sneed about his diagnosis, the court speculated, because doing so would have demonstrated that he was “mentally vulnerable to Glossip’s manipulation and control.” The ruling cleared the way for the state to set a new execution date for Glossip. Knight, his attorney, vowed to appeal to the Supreme Court, calling it “unconscionable” for the OCCA to “attempt to force the state to move forward with this execution” given the attorney general himself agreed that the state’s star witness had been discredited. The Supreme Court stayed Glossip’s execution just days before he was set to die.</p> <br>', 1),

Photo: Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images</p> <br><p>AFTER ELON MUSK finalized his purchase of Twitter on October 27, 2022, I wrote an article in which I warned, “We need to take seriously the possibility that this will end up being one of the funniest things that’s ever happened.”</p> <br><p>Today, I have to issue an apology: I was wrong. Musk’s ownership of Twitter may well be — at least for people who manage to enjoy catastrophic human folly — the funniest thing that’s ever happened.</p> <br><p>Let’s take a look back and see how I was so mistaken.</p> <br><p>Musk began his tenure as Twitter’s owner by posting this message to the company’s advertisers, in which he said, “Twitter aspires to be the most respected advertising platform in the world that strengthens your brand and grows your enterprise. … Twitter obviously cannot be a free-for-all hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences! In addition to adhering to the laws of the land, our platform must be warm and welcoming to all.”</p> <br><p>Musk had to say this for obvious reasons: 90 percent of Twitter’s revenues came from ads, and corporate America gets nervous about its ads appearing in an environment that’s completely unpredictable. </p> <br><p>I assumed that Musk would make a serious effort here. But this was based on my belief that, while he might be a deeply sincere ultra-right-wing crank, he surely had the level of self-control possessed by a 6-year-old. He does not. Big corporations now comprehend this and are understandably anxious about advertising with a company run by a man who, at any moment, may see user @JGoebbels1488 posting excerpts from “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion” and reply “concerning!”</p> <br><p>The consequences of this have been what you’d expect. The marketing consultancy Ebiquity represents 70 of the 100 companies that spend the most on ads, including Google and General Motors.

Ebiquity’s chief strategy officer told Business Insider that “this is a drop we have not seen before for any major advertising platform.” </p> <br><p>This is why Twitter users now largely see ads from micro-entrepreneurs who are, say, selling 1/100th scale papier-mâché models of the Eiffel Tower. The good news for Twitter is that such companies don’t worry much about brand safety. But the bad news is that their annual advertising budget is $25. Hence, Twitter’s advertising revenue in the U.S. is apparently downOpens in a new tab 60 percent year over year.</p> <br><p>I also never imagined it possible that Musk would rename Twitter — which had become an incredibly well-known brand — to “X” just because he’s been obsessed with the idea of a company with that name since he was a kid.

When vinyl chloride burns, it can cause even more harm, releasing a highly toxic class of chemical compounds known as dioxins.</p> <br><p>A 2023 Toxic-Free Future reportOpens in a new tab noted that at least four low-income communities of color in Louisiana have been forced to relocate due to contamination from the vinyl plastics industry. This includes Mossville, one of the first towns founded by freed slaves in the South. Toxicology tests conducted by the federal government determined that Mossville residents, living in the shadow of pollution from vinyl chloride manufacturers, had elevated levels of dioxins in their bodies.</p> <br><p>That testing was completed in 1998.

But as members of the Vinyl Institute, the leading lobbying group for the PVC and vinyl chloride industry, the four companies are fighting hard to convince lawmakers that PVC is safe and sustainable.</p> <br><p>While the group has been active on Capitol Hill for decades, it upped its federal lobbying spend to $560,000 last year. According to disclosures, lobbyists met with lawmakers to discuss topics like the regulation of polyvinyl chloride and the Break Free From Plastic Pollution Act, which seeks to reduce the production of single-use plastics. The Vinyl Institute opposes the act, rallying for unprovenOpens in a new tab chemical recyclingOpens in a new tab technologies over source reduction strategies.</p> <br><p>At the state level, the Vinyl Institute’s website boastsOpens in a new tab that it “worked close with state partners to slow down or stop PVC bans around the nation.” Legislation introduced in Maine, California, and New York last year in the wake of the East Palestine derailment sought to ban the use of PVC and other toxic substances in consumer packaging.

The sound punctures the eerie silence of a deserted public housing complex next door, separated from the plant by only a fence and some railroad tracks. \r\n\r\n</p> <br><p>No children play on the jungle gym here anymore, and no families bustle in and out of front doors. Last year, after mounting concern from the community over Norlite’s air emissions, the Cohoes Housing Authority began relocating all residents of the 70-unit Saratoga Sites complex. The city now plans to raze the homes. </p> <br><p>For more than 30 years, the New York Department of Environmental Conservation, or DEC, has attempted to force Norlite to comply with state environmental laws, issuing the plant hundreds of thousands of dollars in penalties. But even dozens of violations dating back to the 1990sOpens in a new tab have failed to stop Norlite from polluting. Last year, when New York Attorney General Letitia James and the DEC took the extra step of suing the plantOpens in a new tab, alleging its emissions endangered the health of the surrounding community, many nearby residents welcomed the escalation. But as the lawsuit plays out, the state has allowed Norlite to remain in operation, even as the plant continues to violate environmental laws — a move that many community members see as a capitulation. </p> <br><p>“We should be able to breathe clean air, and we’re not,” said Ed Sokol, 89, who has lived near the plant his entire life and is active with Lights Out Norlite, a group of former Saratoga Sites residents and local advocates. “This has been going on for years, and it’s about time — if they’re violating all these laws, shut them down.”</p> <br><p>Now, Lights Out Norlite is turning to a new constitutional provision — dubbed the “Green Amendment” — in the hopes that it will finally help them do just that.\r\n\r\n</p> <br><p>Passed by voters in 2021, the Green Amendment enshrines New Yorkers’ fundamental and inalienable right to clean air, water, and a “healthful environment” in the state constitution. As an addition to the bill of rights, the amendment grants environmental rights the highest constitutional protections, akin to freedom of speech or religion. </p> <br><p>The state, however, has called on the court to dismiss Lights Out Norlite’s Green Amendment claim entirely — and the attorney general is arguing to limit the amendment’s reach.</p> <br><p>The showdown between the state and Lights Out Norlite is one of the first tests of New York’s Green Amendment, and the court’s decision could have reverberations around the country. If the court sides with the attorney general, legal scholars and advocates say that interpretation could topple the amendment’s promise. Since New York is only the third state to enshrine a Green Amendment in its bill of rights — and the first to do so in 50 years — the results of these early cases could impact ongoing efforts to pass similar amendments in more than a dozen states across the country.</p> <br><p>Attorney Maya K. van Rossum, founder of the national advocacy group Green Amendments For The Generations, said that the DEC and attorney general “are really trying to just diminish their obligations to protect the environmental rights of the people” with an argument that would “render impotent the New York Green Amendment.” </p> <br><p>But if the court sides with Lights Out Norlite, van Rossum added, the outcome would “provide real inspiration and power for other states that are pursuing this pathway.”</p> <br>', 1),
(94, 'When Idiot Savants Do Climate Economics', 'environnement', '<img src=\"../ImageBase/GettyImages-1047733276-tp.webp\" alt=\"article-image\"><p>How an elite clique of math-addled economists hijacked climate policy.</p> <br><p>WILLIAM NORDHAUS, WHO turned 82 this year, was the first economist in our time to attempt to quantify the cost of climate change. His climate-modeling wizardry, which won him the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2018, has made him one of the world’s most consequential thinkers. His ideas have been adopted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, global risk managers, the financial services industry, and universities worldwide that teach climate economics. Nordhaus’s work literally could affect the lives of billions of people. This is because his quantification of the immediate costs of climate action — as balanced against the long-term economic harms of not acting — is the basis of key proposals to mitigate carbon emissions. It’s not an exaggeration to suggest that the fate of nations and a sizable portion of humanity depends on whether his projections are correct.</p> <br><p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has assumed Nordhaus is to be trusted. The integrated assessment models used at the IPCC are based on Nordhausian visions of adaptation to warming that only marginally reduces global gross domestic product. If future GDP is barely affected by rising temperatures, there’s less incentive for world governments to act now to reduce emissions.</p> <br><p>Nordhaus’s models tell us that at a temperature rise somewhere between 2.7 and 3.5 degrees Celsius, the global economy reaches “optimal” adaptation. What’s optimal in this scenario is that fossil fuels can continue to be burned late into the 21st century, powering economic growth, jobs, and innovation. Humanity, asserts Nordhaus, can adapt to such warming with modest infrastructure investments, gradual social change, and, in wealthy developed countries, little sacrifice. All the while, the world economy expands with the spewing of more carbon.</p> <br><img src=\"../ImageBase/GettyImages-1258382843-drought.webp\" alt=\"article-image\"><p>His models, it turns out, are fatally flawed, and a growing number of Nordhaus’s colleagues are repudiating his work. Joseph Stiglitz, former World Bank chief economist and professor of economics at Columbia University, told me recently that Nordhaus’s projections are “wildly wrong.” Stiglitz singled out as especially bizarre the idea that optimization of the world economy would occur at 3.5 C warming, which physical scientists say would produce global chaos and a kind of climate genocide in the poorest and most vulnerable nations.\r\n\r\n</p> <br><p>In a journal articleOpens in a new tab published last year, Stiglitz and co-authors Nicholas Stern and Charlotte Taylor, of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science, declared that Nordhausian integrated assessment models are “inadequate to capture deep uncertainty and extreme risk.” They fail to incorporate “potential loss of lives and livelihoods on immense scale and fundamental transformation and destruction of our natural environment.”</p> <br><p>Climate change is one of the instances, Stiglitz and Stern told me in an email, in which “it is generally agreed there is extreme risk — we know there are some really extreme events that could occur — and we know we cannot pretend (i.e., act as if) we know the probabilities. Nordhaus’s work doesn’t appropriately take into account either extreme risk or deep uncertainty.”</p> <br><p>In other words, the economist who has been embraced as a guiding light by the global institution tasked with shepherding humanity through the climate crisis, who has been awarded a Nobel for climate costing, who is widely feted as the doyen of his field, doesn’t know what he’s talking about.</p> <br><p>AMONG MOST SCIENTISTS, it’s lunacy to discuss optimization of anything anywhere when the globe hits even 2 C warming. Climate researchers Yangyang Xu and Veerabhadran Ramanathan, in a widely cited 2017 paperOpens in a new tab, defined 1.5 C warming as “dangerous” and 3 C or greater as “catastrophic,” while above 5 C was “beyond catastrophic,” with consequences that include “existential threats.” The late Will Steffen, a pioneering Earth systems thinker, warned alongside many of his colleagues that 2 C was a critical marker. At 2 C warming, we could “activate other tipping elements in a domino-like cascade that could take the Earth system to even higher temperatures.” Such “tipping cascades” could lead quickly to “conditions that would be inhospitable to current human societies,” a scenario known as hothouse Earth.</p> <br><p>But the path to hothouse Earth will be long and tortured. When I interviewed him in 2021, Steffen, who died last January at age 75, was concerned about “near-term collapse” of the global food system. Drought and heat have already reduced global cereal production by as much as 10 percent in recent years, according to Steffen. “Food shocks are likely to get much worse,” he wrote in a 2019 pieceOpens in a new tab co-authored with Aled Jones, director of the Global Sustainability Institute at Anglia Ruskin University. “The risk of multi-breadbasket failure is increasing, and rises much faster beyond 1.5 C of global heating. … Such shocks pose grave threats — rocketing food prices, civil unrest, major financial losses, starvation, and death.” </p> <br><p>In a 2022 reportOpens in a new tab titled “Climate Endgame: Exploring Catastrophic Climate Change Scenarios,” 11 leading Earth systems and climate scientists, Steffen among them, concluded there is “ample evidence that climate change could become catastrophic … at even modest levels of warming.” According to the report:</p> <br><p>Climate change could exacerbate vulnerabilities and cause multiple, indirect stresses (such as economic damage, loss of land, and water and food insecurity) that coalesce into system-wide synchronous failures. … It is plausible that a sudden shift in climate could trigger systems failures that unravel societies across the globe.</p> <br><p>What these scientists are describing is global civilizational collapse, possibly in the lifetime of a young or even middle-aged reader of this article. </p> <br><p>According to the “Climate Endgame” report, the current trajectory of carbon emissions puts the world on track for a temperature rise between 2.1 C and 3.9 C by 2100. This is a horrific prospect. Earth systems analysts tell us that habitable and cultivable land in a 3 C to 4 C warming regime would be so reduced and ecosystem services so battered that the deaths of billions of people could occur in the next eight decades or less.</p> <br>', 1),

Boomers drove jam-packed VW vans in a haze of drugs to Woodstock; now they scoot around The Villages in golf carts festooned with Trump flags.</p> <br><p>The boomer rallying cry of the 1960s was “Don’t trust anyone over 30.” Boomers today can’t stop whining about how young people are too “woke.”</p> <br><p>I’m a baby boomer myself, and I no longer recognize my own generation. A big slice of white boomers are now living on hate. They hate nearly everything and everybody — even Disney and Taylor Swift! — because Trump and MAGA and Fox News have told them to. They hate books, vaccines, colleges, unions, corporations, cities, Hollywood, Broadway, the NBA and the NFL, Black people, brown people, and of course immigrants. They really hate immigrants. They are convinced that college professors and journalists secretly control America.</p> <br><p>My generation has not aged well.</p> <br><p>I blame Trump for the boomers’ weird transformation from a youthful progressive force into a tribe of right-wing conspiracy theorists. To be sure, there are plenty of boomers who haven’t succumbed to Trump-induced hate. But too many of us fell for him when he first emerged as a dangerous demagogue spewing racism and lies, and boomers have fueled his rise ever since.</p> <br><p>White boomers have had a conservative streak since the Reagan era of “greed is good” in the 1980s. But Trump and his presidency sent the boomers’ rightward shift into overdrive, and many have gone all the way into the thrall of the MAGA cult. Trump brought far-right politics to the fore among his fellow boomers, playing on their fears of America’s growing racial diversity.</p> <br><p>White boomers now make up a key segment of Trump’s base. He is a threat to democracy today mainly because so many in my generation are willing to hand him unlimited power. I find it depressing that people I grew up with have allowed their brains to curdle to the point that they are willing to abandon the democratic values that were central to the American society we boomers inherited.</p> <br><p><h4>From Huckster to Extremist</h4> <br> <br>\r\nFrom the start, the extraordinary demographics of the boomer generation have set it apart. As American soldiers came home from World War II in 1945 after the defeat of Germany and Japan, they were eager to make up for lost time and start families. That created a sudden baby boom in 1946, a year after the war’s end. But the boom surprisingly continued for decades, as Americans, benefiting from sustained economic growth in the 1950s and ’60s, found they could afford to have larger families. Demographers have defined the boomer generation as the 76 million people born between 1946 and 1964, a period when the U.S. total fertility rate — an estimate of lifetime fertility — exploded from 2.49 children per woman in 1945 to a peak of 3.77 in 1957. (For comparison’s sake, the total fertility rate in 2022 was just 1.67Opens in a new tab.)</p> <br><p>The millennial generation (those born roughly between 1981-1996) has now surpassed boomersOpens in a new tab as the largest living adult generation, but the boomers have certainly been one of the most politically dominant generations America has ever seen. There have now been four boomer presidents, including two from each major party: Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Trump. (Joe Biden, born in 1942, belongs to the so-called Silent Generation, which includes those born between 1928 and 1946: the children of the Great Depression.)</p> <br><p>Even with a Silent Generation president, boomers still hold sway over the American establishment. A generational power indexOpens in a new tab, created in 2021 by the Visual Capitalist website, calculated the overall economic, political, and cultural power of each living generation, and found that boomers still ranked first with 43.4 percent of the nation’s economic power and 47.4 percent of political power. They only trailed in cultural power, where Generation X (1965-1980) led with 36 percent.</p> <br><p>Donald Trump, born on June 14, 1946, was one of the first boomers. But unlike the fathers of millions of others born that year, Trump’s father, Fred Trump, did not fight in World War II. Instead, he profited from it by building and owning thousands of apartments that he rented out to war workers.</p> <br><p>As the born-wealthy son of a New York real estate mogul, Donald Trump skipped the anti-war and the civil rights movements, and never shared the counter-cultural experiences of the 1960s and early 1970s that so defined the boomers’ coming of age. He was enamored instead of money and money-making and burnishing his own image, and his Scrooge-like tendencies would finally align him with the rest of his generation as boomers moved into their 30s and 40s in the Reagan era.</p> <br><p>When Obama became the nation’s first Black president in 2008, boomer politics really began to warp into something ugly. By then, the oldest boomers were in their early 60s, and they proved susceptible to Trump when he began to transform himself from a corporate huckster into an extremist political figure who used conspiracy theories about the president’s birth certificate to gain right-wing notoriety.</p> <br>', 1);

Perot took millions of votes from disaffected Republicans angered by President George H.W. Bush’s willingness to compromise with congressional Democrats on taxes. When Bush ran for president in 1988, one of his key campaign pledges had been not to raise taxes; his reversal once he was in office fueled Perot’s rise.

(99, 'Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare', 'AI', '<img src=\"../ImageBase/Impact-of-AI-and-Robotics-in-the-Healthcare-Industry.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\"><p>Transforming Healthcare: The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Revolutionizing Patient Care</p> <br><p>In today\'s rapidly evolving technological landscape, one innovation stands out for its potential to revolutionize healthcare: artificial intelligence (AI). From diagnostics to personalized treatment plans, AI is reshaping the way we approach patient care, offering unprecedented insights, efficiency, and precision. In this article, we delve into the transformative power of AI in healthcare and explore the myriad ways it is improving outcomes for patients worldwide.</p> <br><h4>Unprecedented Diagnostic Accuracy\r\n</h4><br><p>One of the most compelling applications of AI in healthcare is its ability to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Advanced AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of medical data—including imaging scans, lab results, and patient records—with remarkable speed and accuracy. This enables healthcare providers to detect diseases at earlier stages, leading to more effective treatment interventions and improved patient outcomes.</p> <br><p>For example, AI-powered imaging technologies, such as deep learning algorithms, have demonstrated exceptional performance in detecting abnormalities in medical scans, such as MRIs and CT scans. These algorithms can identify subtle anomalies that may be overlooked by human radiologists, enabling earlier detection of conditions such as cancer, neurological disorders, and cardiovascular diseases.</p> <br><h4>Personalized Treatment Plans</h4><br><p>AI is also driving advancements in personalized medicine by leveraging patient-specific data to tailor treatment plans and interventions. By analyzing genetic profiles, medical histories, and real-time patient data, AI algorithms can identify patterns and predict individual responses to different treatment modalities.</p> <br><p>This personalized approach allows healthcare providers to optimize treatment strategies, minimize adverse effects, and improve patient outcomes. For instance, AI-powered predictive analytics can help oncologists identify the most effective cancer therapies based on genetic mutations and biomarker profiles, leading to more targeted and efficient treatments.</p> <br><h4>Enhancing Operational Efficiency</h4> <br><p>In addition to improving clinical decision-making, AI is enhancing the operational efficiency of healthcare systems. AI-driven tools and platforms streamline administrative tasks, automate routine processes, and optimize resource allocation, enabling healthcare providers to deliver care more efficiently and cost-effectively.</p> <br><p>For example, natural language processing (NLP) algorithms can analyze and extract insights from unstructured clinical notes, reducing the time and effort required for documentation and information retrieval. Similarly, predictive analytics models can forecast patient admission rates, optimize staff schedules, and allocate resources based on demand, ensuring optimal utilization of hospital resources and enhancing patient flow.</p> <br><h4>Ethical Considerations and Challenges</h4> <br><p>While the potential benefits of AI in healthcare are substantial, it is essential to address ethical considerations and challenges associated with its implementation. Issues such as data privacy, algorithm bias, and transparency must be carefully addressed to ensure that AI technologies are deployed responsibly and equitably.</p> <br><p>Furthermore, the integration of AI into clinical workflows requires ongoing collaboration between healthcare professionals, technologists, policymakers, and patients to ensure that AI solutions are aligned with patient-centered care principles and contribute to positive health outcomes.</p> <br>', 1),
(101, 'Exploring Psychedelic Therapy : Insights from the Joe Rogan Podcast', 'health', '<img src=\"../ImageBase/download (1).jpeg\" alt=\"article-image\"><p>In a recent episode of the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, host Joe Rogan delved into the transformative potential of psychedelic therapy with renowned guests in the field. As the conversation unfolded, viewers were treated to a fascinating exploration of the therapeutic applications of psychedelics and their profound impact on mental health.</p> <br><p></p> <br> <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\"  autoplay=1 src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/35nbHfXQD0Q?si=D8PLY7yudvJSCaNs\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n <br> <p></p> <br><p>At the heart of the discussion was the growing body of research suggesting that psychedelic substances, such as psilocybin (found in magic mushrooms) and MDMA (commonly known as ecstasy), hold promise as powerful tools for treating a range of mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety, PTSD, and addiction.</p> <br><p>One particularly insightful segment of the podcast focused on the concept of ego dissolution – a phenomenon often experienced during psychedelic trips where the boundaries between the self and the external world blur, leading to a profound sense of interconnectedness and unity. Guests on the podcast shared their personal experiences with ego dissolution and reflected on its therapeutic implications.\r\n</p> <br><p>\r\nAccording to experts in the field, ego dissolution can be a catalyst for transformative healing, allowing individuals to gain new perspectives on their lives, break free from habitual thought patterns, and confront unresolved emotional trauma. By temporarily dissolving the ego, psychedelics create an opportunity for individuals to transcend their limited sense of self and experience a profound sense of awe, humility, and interconnectedness with the universe.\r\n\r\n</p> <br><p>Moreover, the podcast explored the crucial role of set and setting in shaping the psychedelic experience. Set refers to the mindset and intentions of the individual undergoing the psychedelic journey, while setting encompasses the physical environment and social context in which the experience takes place. Guests emphasized the importance of creating a safe, supportive, and comfortable setting for psychedelic therapy sessions, as well as cultivating a mindset of openness, surrender, and trust.\r\n</p> <br><p>\r\nAs the conversation unfolded, it became clear that psychedelic therapy represents a paradigm shift in the field of mental health treatment – one that challenges conventional approaches and offers new hope for those suffering from treatment-resistant conditions. While there are still many unanswered questions and challenges to overcome, the growing body of research and anecdotal evidence suggests that psychedelic therapy has the potential to revolutionize mental health care and usher in a new era of healing and transformation.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the Joe Rogan podcast provided a thought-provoking glimpse into the world of psychedelic therapy, shedding light on its therapeutic potential, challenges, and implications for mental health care. By fostering open dialogue and exploration of this emerging field, podcasts like Joe Rogan\'s are helping to catalyze a broader conversation about the role of psychedelics in healing and personal growth, paving the way for a more enlightened and compassionate approach to mental health treatment.</p> <br>', 1),
(102, 'META CONSIDERING INCREASED CENSORSHIP OF THE WORD “ZIONIST”', 'world', '<img src=\"../ImageBase/AP23235585829489-meta-zionism.webp\" alt=\"article-image\"><p>“I think it may actually harm the fight against antisemitism,” said the head of a Palestinian digital rights group briefed on the potential change.</p> <br><p>FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM’S parent company, Meta, is contemplating stricter rules around discussing Israeli nationalism on its platforms, a major policy change that could stifle criticism and free expression about the war in Gaza and beyond, five civil society sources who were briefed on the potential change told The Intercept.</p> <br><p>“Meta is currently revisiting its hate speech policy, specifically in relation to the term ‘Zionist,’” reads a January 30 email sent to civil society groups by Meta policy personnel and reviewed by The Intercept. While the email says Meta has not made a final determination, it is soliciting feedback on a potential policy change from civil society and digital rights groups, according to the sources. The email notes that “Meta is reviewing this policy in light of content that users and stakeholders have recently reported” but does not detail the content in question or name any stakeholders.</p> <br><p>“As an anti-Zionist Jewish organization for Palestinian freedom, we are horrified to learn that Meta is considering expanding when they treat ‘Zionism’ — a political ideology — as the same as ‘Jew/Jewish’ — an ethno-religious identity,” said Dani Noble, an organizer with Jewish Voice for Peace, one of the groups Meta has contacted to discuss the possible change. Noble added that such a policy shift “will result in shielding the Israeli government from accountability for its policies and actions that violate Palestinian human rights.”</p> <br><p>For years, Meta has allowed its 3 billion users around the world to employ the term “Zionist,” which refers to supporters of the historical movement to create a Jewish state in the Middle East, as well as backers of modern-day nationalism in support of that state and its policies.</p> <br><p>Meta’s internal rules around the word “Zionist,” first reported by The Intercept in 2021, show that company moderators are only supposed to delete posts using the term if it’s determined to be a proxy for “Jewish” or “Israeli,” both protected classes under company speech rules. The policy change Meta is now considering would enable the platform’s moderators to more aggressively and expansively enforce this rule, a move that could dramatically increase deletions of posts critical of Israeli nationalism.</p> <br><p>“We don’t allow people to attack others based on their protected characteristics, such as their nationality or religion. Enforcing this policy requires an understanding of how people use language to reference those characteristics,” Meta spokesperson Corey Chambliss told The Intercept. “While the term Zionist often refers to a person’s ideology, which is not a protected characteristic, it can also be used to refer to Jewish or Israeli people. Given the increase in polarized public discourse due to events in the Middle East, we believe it’s important to assess our guidance for reviewing posts that use the term Zionist.”</p> <br><p>In the months since October 7, staunchly pro-Israel groups like the Anti-Defamation League have openly called for treating anti-Zionism as a form of antisemitism, pointing out that the word is often used by antisemites as a stand-in for “Jew.” The ADL and American Jewish Committee, another pro-Israel, Zionist advocacy group in the U.S., have both been lobbying Meta to restrict use of the word “Zionist,” according to Yasmine Taeb, legislative and political director at the Muslim grassroots advocacy group MPower Change. In his statement, Chambliss responded, “We did not initiate this policy development at the behest of any outside group.”</p> <br><p>Taeb, who spoke to a Meta employee closely involved with the proposed policy change, said it would result in mass censorship of critical mentions of Zionism, restricting, for example, non-hateful, non-violent speech about the ongoing bloodshed in Gaza.</p> <br><p>While a statement as general as “I don’t like Zionists” could be uttered by an antisemitic Instagram user as a means of expressing dislike for Jews, civil society advocates point out that there is nothing inherently or necessarily anti-Jewish about the statement. Indeed, much of the fiercest political activism against Israel’s war in Gaza has been organized by anti-Zionist Jews, while American evangelical Christian Zionists are some of Israel’s most hardcore supporters.</p> <br><p>“The suppression of pro-Palestinian speech critical of Israel is happening specifically during the genocide in Gaza,” Taeb said in an interview. “Meta should instead be working on implementing policies to make sure political speech is not being suppressed, and they’re doing the exact opposite.”</p> <br><p>ACCORDING TO PRESENTATION materials reviewed by The Intercept, Meta has been sharing with stakeholders a series of hypothetical posts that could be deleted under a stricter policy, and soliciting feedback as to whether they should be. While one example seemed like a clear case of conspiratorial antisemitic tropes about Jewish control of the news media, others were critical of Israeli state policy or supporters of that policy, not Judaism, said Nadim Nashif, executive director of the Palestinian digital rights group 7amleh, who was briefed this week by Meta via video conference. Meta plans to brief U.S. stakeholder groups on Friday morning, according to its outreach email.</p> <br>', 1),

Prabowo Subianto, a longtime U.S. protégé implicated in the country’s massacres, once mused to me about becoming “a fascist dictator” and is now a serious threat to assume the presidency.\r\n</p> <br><p>\r\nFor Prabowo, as he is known, to be elected in February 14’s first round of voting, he must get 50 percent-plus-one of the accepted ballots in the three-way vote and receive at least 20 percent of the votes in 19 of Indonesia’s 38 provinces.</p> <br><p>In 2001, I met and interviewed Prabowo twice, discussing army massacres — including one, in Dili, East Timor, which I happened to survive — and democracy in Indonesia.\r\n<br><br>\r\n“Indonesia is not ready for democracy,” he told me in those meetings. The country, he said, needs “a benign authoritarian regime.”\r\n\r\nPrabowo expressed support for army rule. He praised a recent coup in Pakistan and mused about making a similar move in Indonesia. “Do I have the guts?” he asked rhetorically. “Am I ready to be called a fascist dictator?”\r\n<br><br>\r\nPrabowo has since repeatedly attempted coups and failed twice in presidential elections.</p> <br><p>Today, however, he has the state apparatus behind him, mobilized by the incumbent civilian President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, who had previously privately discussed with his staff trying the general for war crimes.\r\n</p> <br><p>\r\nThe levers of state power are playing a pivotal role in the campaign. Local officials are being threatened with prosecution if they do not back the general. And across the country, army and police are instructing people to vote for Prabowo, a directive with special weight for poorer people who live at their mercy. Government-distributed bags of rice and cooking oil are turning up across the country with Prabowo stickers. Families who need to get the provisions must sometimes pick them up at Prabowo campaign offices.</p> <br>', 1),
(107, 'HISTORIC TURNOUT IN  PAKISTAN IS SWAMPING THE MILITARY’S EFFORT TO RIG THE ELECTION', 'world', '<img src=\"../ImageBase/GettyImages-1988125159.webp\" alt=\"article-image\"><p>In a turbulent 24 hours following Pakistan’s elections, the U.S.-backed military has proved unable to suppress the populist movement interrogating its authority.\r\n\r\n</p> <br><p>LAST YEAR IN Pakistan, a bystander happened to catch, on camera, police raiding the Sialkot home of Usman Dar. At the time, Dar was an opposition candidate representing former Prime Minister Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, or PTI, party — which the military and its civilian allies were busy suppressing with abductions, raids, blackmail, and threats. Khan, a populist prime minister, was forced from office in 2022 under military pressure with the encouragement of the U.S. \r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough a window, video shows Pakistani police officials assaulting Dar’s elderly mother, Rehana Dar, in her bedroom. Dar’s brother, Umar Dar, was also picked up, though police only acknowledged he’d been arrested much later at a court hearing. When Usman Dar emerged from custody, he announced he was stepping down from the race and leaving the party — as many other PTI candidates have done under similar pressure. \r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nBut then came a new wrinkle, a symbol of the refusal of Khan’s supporters to bow to the military-backed government. While the news was announced that Dar was withdrawing from the race, and with another son still missing, his mother went on television to say that she would be running instead. “Khawaja Asif,” Rehana Dar said in a video posted on social media directed to the army-backed political rival of her son, “You have achieved what you wanted by making my son step down at gunpoint, but my son has quit politics, not me. Now you will face me in politics.”</p> <br><p>She was a political novice, an angry mother who represented the country’s frustration with its ruling elite. “Send me to jail or handcuff me. I will contest the general elections for sure,” she said while filing her nomination papers. Those papers were initially rejected — like they were for so many PTI candidates, and only PTI candidates — and she had to refile.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nNevertheless, she persisted. On Thursday night, election night, with her son Umar still in custody, she shocked the country. With 99 percent of precincts counted, she had beaten that lifetime politician, Khawaja Asif, with 131,615 to 82,615 votes. The loss by Asif, who was allied with Nawaz Sharif — the military-backed candidate whose victory Vox had called “almost a fait accompli” — was a blow to the army. \r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThen came one more wrinkle — one that many in Pakistan expected, but which was still shocking. When the full results were announced, Dar’s total had been reduced by 31,434 votes, while Asif gained votes, and he was declared the winner. </p> <br>', 1),
(108, '“WHERE CAN OUR CHILDREN GO ?”: TERROR AND PANIC SET IN AS ISRAEL READIES TO INVADE RAFAH', 'world', '<img src=\"../ImageBase/AP24041733347242-rafah-gaza.webp\" alt=\"article-image\"><p>Palestinians in Rafah’s rapidly growing makeshift camps talk about all they have lost and endured throughout four months of Israel’s war on Gaza.\r\n\r\n</p> <br><p>RAFAH, GAZA — IT WAS A night of terror in Rafah. Early Monday morning, the Israeli military rained bombs on the city in southern Gaza that borders Egypt. The ground shook, the sound of fighter jets dropping bombs so intense and persistent that some described it as a “fire belt,” a term Palestinians use to describe the prolonged targeting of nearby areas. At least 100 people were killed in the bombings, which some of Rafah’s inhabitants said were among the worst of the war.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThey would know. Rafah is the last available refuge for at least 1.3 million Palestinians who have fled their homes since October. They have been repeatedly displaced from across the rest of the occupied territory, making their way to an area that the Israeli military had designated a “safe zone.”\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\nAn Israeli military official described Monday’s bombing as a “diversion,” part of an effort to rescue two Israeli hostages. The intense assault appeared to be a prelude to many more horrors to come, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Friday that a long-feared ground invasion of the city is imminent. He ordered a mass evacuation of civilians there — a prospect that is, simply put, impossible, given the number of displaced people currently in Rafah and the fact that there is nowhere left to go.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSince the beginning of the war, Rafah has transformed into a tent city that United Nations officials warned is a “pressure cooker of despair.” As the number of people killed, missing, or wounded during Israel’s four-month war recently topped 100,000, some 1.9 million people — more than 85 percent of Gaza’s population — have been internally displaced. The vast majority of them are crammed at the border with Egypt, where they face an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe that has been compounded in recent days by the uncertainty of Rafah’s viability as the last refuge in Gaza.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn the days preceding Monday’s assault, humanitarian and human rights organizations, as well as the U.S. government, had issued urgent warnings that a full-scale attack on the city would be the most devastating yet.\r\n<br><br>\r\n“This escalation would significantly exacerbate the ongoing genocidal acts perpetrated by the Israeli military and authorities against the Palestinian population in Gaza,” a coalition of Palestinian human rights groups warned last week, noting that the feared ground invasion would be in violation of the measures ordered by the International Court of Justice last month.</p> <br>', 1);
